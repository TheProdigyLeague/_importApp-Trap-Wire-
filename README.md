> "The assumption is that big scary bad guys and super naughty people will attack my innocent civilians...So, we need to conduct 'pre-attack surveillance' effective immediately, this is good for people. We will photograph them, measure their activities, and signal our servers constantly for suspicious activity. We will also detect their images, reports, and pre-screen them into our databases as needed. Using a 10 step characteristic description key matching software utilizing artificial vehicle individual token information data correlated across networks. Claiming, hence, "The network effect." Due to increased and heightened security. TIM was born of this idea that each level of monitoring by our pre-hired security personnel will distinguish what is and is not a threat or vulnerability to our shareable latter network..." ~ Hollis, probably

An integrated federal informant program known as "Trap Wire" kept an eye on citizens for potential attack routes and implemented surveillance schemes that "trapped and wire tapped" telephone conversations. Much the same as the NSA does now. This is a coding exercise intended for programmers and developers who are interested in the Fortune 500 firm formerly known as Incorporated Venture Enterprise. Federal Agent Deputies initiated this after September 2001.

## Install

Since Trap-Wire was never really software, there isn't exactly a means to "install Trap-Wire systems". A "Surveillance Program en masse" was more accurate. All the same implications are made, nonetheless. But, the source of their inspiration is in all the legalese and technical jargon Big Tech uses, and has used, in large-scale data mining apps, adware schemes, and APIs. Thus, a docker file on installing a vulnerability scanner is more appropriate to display...
